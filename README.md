This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, create an `.env.local` file and add the preview token there:

```conf
CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

Then, install deps:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

After this, the project will be ready to reproduce the issue i've described.
